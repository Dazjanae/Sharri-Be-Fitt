# Sharri-Be-Fitt

<h2>Project Title</h2>
Sharri Be Fitt

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a webpage which allows viewing of this business' details such as an "about me" section, the variety of product options, and a weight loss calculator. For this project, HTML was used to add needed content and details for the client, CSS was used to make this site visually appealing and easier to navigate, and a tad of Javascript was used to create a weight loss/gain calculator to help clients determine a clear number to help reach their goals.  In the future, I plan on adding more CSS & JS animation features to keep client attention.
